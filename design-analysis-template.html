   <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>
   <h2></h2>
   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
    Within this photo we can see how the spacing between categories is uniformed. It is also noteworthy that each section is the same width and height. Clearance however, is larger probably due to the company wanting to sell old inventory quicker.
   </p>

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;
    All of us
   </h3>

   <p>
    Here we can see how one may be able to signup for promotional alerts. There is also contact information in regards to any product. The contact information is centered to allow alignment importance of these services. 
   </p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   <p>
    We can see here how the spacing for each section is repeated multiple times. This gives the viewer a chance to look at things of importance. In the section of the promotion we can see that both men and women section are the same and neither takes precedence over the other. 
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;

   <p>
    Contrast is a design principle that catches attention and attracts viewers by using two significantly different items together. It can be an item, text, image, etc. Essentially, contrast is difference. This image uses contrast for a specific purpose. The sale price is big and highlighted in red. Just above that, the original price is in black and bold, but it is not nearly as noticeable as the sale price. The company wants you to look at the sale price and see how much you are saving by buying the item now with the sale.

   <h3>Typography &mdash;

   <p>
    Typography uses different fonts and styles to show emphasis in certain areas. In the following photo we can se how the italics font is used to appeal in the clearance. The words final and clearance are also bolded to show importance.
